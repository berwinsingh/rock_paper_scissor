# rock_paper_scissor

As I have started my journey to become a web developer. The best way to learn programming is by doing. Thus, I have created a Rock, Paper & Scissors game to showcase my learnings till now, the game has a minimal front-end along with a back-end solution that automatically generates a response for the computer from an array using Math.Random().

I will keep on adding new things and try to make the code more efficient whenever possible. Thanks for your supprt!ðŸ˜ƒ
